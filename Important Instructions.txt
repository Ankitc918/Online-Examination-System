1. copy the project folder in your projects directory in visual studio/projects/.

2. copy .mdf & .ldf files for database in SQL server 'DATA' folder (where .mdf & .ldf are located).

3. attach the copied files in step 2 in your database by right clicking on server explorer , select attach database , then select the copied .mdf file.

4. run the project , that's it.
